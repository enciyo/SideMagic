# SideMagic Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Overview

SideMagic is a browser extension that lets you open AI chatbots in the side panel and attach the current webpage’s content to the chat as a file. This policy describes what data the extension uses and where it goes.

## Data We Use

### Website content

When you use the “attach” feature (e.g. `/website` or `/website-text`), the extension reads the **current tab’s** HTML or text. That content is sent only to the **AI chatbot you chose** (e.g. Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Grok, Kimi). We do **not** store this content on our servers. We have no servers; the extension runs locally in your browser.

### Local storage

The extension may store on your device:

- Command palette state (e.g. last selected command)
- Other UI preferences

This data stays on your device and is not sent to us or any third party.

## What We Do Not Do

- We do **not** collect personally identifiable information (name, email, etc.).
- We do **not** collect web history, location, or authentication credentials.
- We do **not** sell or share your data with third parties for advertising or other purposes.
- We do **not** use your data for anything unrelated to the extension’s single purpose (attaching page content to AI chatbots).

## Third-Party Services

When you attach page content, that content is sent to the AI provider of the chatbot you are using (e.g. Google, Anthropic, xAI, Moonshot). Their privacy policies apply to how they process that data. We do not control those services.

## Changes

We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do.

## Contact

For questions about this privacy policy or the extension, open an issue in the [SideMagic repository](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SideMagic) or use the support link provided in the store listing.
